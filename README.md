## Inside the game

The tutorial scene exercises the actual movement and jump path after account creation and lobby navigation.

## What I built across the game

I developed Unity movement, obstacles, tutorials, appearance and shop flows, and C++ server handling for accounts, matchmaking and match communication.

[![My implementation flow](https://ysl-ryudo.github.io/assets/diagrams/dumbguys-flow-en.svg)](https://ysl-ryudo.github.io/assets/diagrams/dumbguys-flow-en.svg)

### Movement strategies and character control

Separated input, movement strategy, character state and the Rigidbody motor. Normal, slippery and dash strategies vary movement through the same motor; animation follows the character state. This gives movement variations a shared physics implementation.

[CharacterMotor.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/Player/CharacterMotor.cs), [My change 27bfa58](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/27bfa58811079f0886733c49174ce9627cbae910), [IMovementStrategy.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/Player/IMovementStrategy.cs), [My change e9d0b38](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/e9d0b380cfe1eb297fbf68c38a00f77ad37b53f2)

### Obstacles and spline transport

Implemented push/knock-up interactions, moving-platform attachment and curved pipe transport. Pipe travel temporarily changes Rigidbody handling, follows spline position and tangent, then restores control. An editor generator supports authoring the pipe path.

[PipeTransportCurved.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/PipeTransportCurved.cs), [My change 359f276](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/359f27621811e1cdc667328cfb55d799340cb3e6), [PipeSplineGenerator.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Editor/PipeSplineGenerator.cs), [My change 27bfa58](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/27bfa58811079f0886733c49174ce9627cbae910)

### Match entry and remote presentation

Implemented loading readiness, spawn and appearance exchange, and remote position/rotation presentation. GameSceneController also handles hit and result messages. The network layer dispatches work to Unity's main thread rather than manipulating scene objects from the receive thread.

[LoadingSceneController.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/LoadingScene/LoadingSceneController.cs), [My change 87533da](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/87533da63f475a3a306ffa38833e6c72ed8b378e), [GameSceneController.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/GameScene/GameSceneController.cs), [My change 6d033d0](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/6d033d0bfd08eaf765251653d99a5b85253ca821), [UnityMainThreadDispatcher.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/Network/UnityMainThreadDispatcher.cs), [My change 87533da](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/87533da63f475a3a306ffa38833e6c72ed8b378e)

### Tutorials and course completion

Built tutorial managers with hints, fall and win triggers, and gameplay finish/fall handling. This covers teaching controls and resolving the course outcome as well as moving the character.

[Tutorial0Manager.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/Tutorial0Scene/Tutorial0Manager.cs), [My change 6d033d0](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/6d033d0bfd08eaf765251653d99a5b85253ca821), [Tutorial1Manager.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/Tutorial1Scene/Tutorial1Manager.cs), [My change 8b0ac0c](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/8b0ac0c91640a2154f89b77656c9f0daa07ca458), [WinZone.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/GameScene/WinZone.cs), [My change 87533da](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/87533da63f475a3a306ffa38833e6c72ed8b378e)

### Appearance, store and server state

Built category-based store and profile appearance screens and connected them to owned-item and appearance data. The server's match and account processing supports the loop from lobby selection through gameplay and results; the matching policy is explained separately below.

[StoreManager.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/StoreScene/StoreManager.cs), [My change edffcc8](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/edffcc86e34c4d817a000462dbbe19502d4843fe), [MyPageManager.cs (restore-1121)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/blob/6c30b670a68da9a89d8ad0445de376cd620a21a7/Assets/Scripts/MyPageScene/MyPageManager.cs), [My change 94edd35](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuys/commit/94edd358e09412d75e7836ee8f7ff17519f206fe), [MatchManager.cpp (main)](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuysServer/blob/75ad6626d21d7638d37240c85ff4a9aa481e5620/DumbGuysServer/MatchManager.cpp), [My change bb103b5](https://github.com/YSL-RyuDo/DumbGuysServer/commit/bb103b5d1c143534126cf8dfb577812eef035d90)

## Implementation and design

Accounts, rooms and player appearance need to carry through the lobby and match flow. A client and server must also be reviewed at compatible revisions.

I worked on account/connection handling, room and player state, store/appearance data and client-side lobby/match integration.

## How the code works and why it is structured this way

### Match criteria change with time spent waiting

**Implementation**

MatchManager compares queued players by rank, score and level, then widens selected thresholds as waiting time grows. On a match it creates a room and sends the participant/spawn information. Client and server also exchange owned items and appearance data for the surrounding lobby flow.

**Design rationale**

Strict similarity and short waiting time can conflict when few compatible players are queued. Time-dependent thresholds make that tradeoff explicit instead of accepting any opponent immediately or waiting indefinitely for an exact match. Keeping ownership and appearance distinct also separates what a player has from what they currently display.

**Alternatives and the current tradeoff**

First-come pairing favors quick matches while ignoring skill similarity. Fixed similarity limits are predictable but can leave outliers waiting. Widening thresholds over time balances those aims explicitly, but choosing the thresholds still requires population and match-quality evidence.

**Tradeoffs and verification**

Thresholds depend on the player population and skill distribution. Cancellation and disconnects must remove waiting entries, while match-quality and wait-time measurements guide tuning.

### Different movement, one physics motor

**Implementation**

IInputProvider supplies direction and jump input; movement strategies call CharacterMotor with different movement multipliers. The motor preserves vertical velocity while blending horizontal velocity and handles turning and grounded jumps.

**Design rationale**

A slippery or dash effect changes movement behavior without requiring another copy of Rigidbody handling. Preserving Y velocity also avoids overwriting gravity or an existing jump when updating planar movement.

**Alternatives and the current tradeoff**

A single movement script with flags is economical for a small number of effects. Separate strategies make the variation explicit but add indirection. The current strategies are small; their value depends on maintaining one shared motor rather than scattering physics changes across them.

**Tradeoffs and verification**

The motor depends on Unity physics and ground checks. Slopes, moving platforms, effect changes during a jump and network correction require coordinated handling.
